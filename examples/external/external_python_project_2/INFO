This repo manages to generate an Android app that can find the config files "app_config.yaml" and "app_config_2.txt" in the Android filesystem as temp files.

The files can be read only using "importlib.resources.read_text()" though, not using the functions defined to read yaml files, because the files can't be found. There is probably a need to use "with open" to access the temp files (accessing the temp path and then the object will not work at all).

Note that on its own in Linux, the PyQt5 app will not work because the module "externalpy" cannot be found.

However, within the Android app, the module "externalpy" is found since it is the root defined in the ".pdt".

The definition of a "pyqtdeploy package" is literally a single "python package" (no sub-packages allowed).
